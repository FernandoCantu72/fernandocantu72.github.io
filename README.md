Throughout each project, I completed all necessary life cycle processes, including initiating, executing, controlling, and completing all assigned projects. My primary duties included coordinating product releases and rollouts, delegating tasks, maintaining timeframes and budgets, managing resources, and communicating with all stakeholders. To ensure successful project outcomes, I implemented various IT strategies that delivered projects on schedule and within budget, utilized project management tools to track project performance, and conducted thorough risk assessments for each. Additionally, I implemented documentation and briefings to support decision-making and communicated project interdependencies, risks, and issues to all stakeholders.<br>

*DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR:* In my role as a database administrator, I was responsible for managing networked system databases and ensuring that property tax information and records were properly stored, organized, and updated. I worked closely with other IT professionals and county employees to achieve this, and I managed the creation and deletion of database accounts while monitoring employee access. Additionally, I assisted Data Analysts and developers by providing them with specific data from the database as queries for research or detailed report writing. I worked closely with data architects and other IT specialists to ensure that the database was properly designed and supported the information needs of the Hidalgo County Tax Office. Finally, I was proficient in report writing software such as Crystal Reports and MS SQL, which allowed me to extract data and generate detailed reports.<br>

*SYSTEMS ANALYST:* As an IT professional, I researched technical reports and legislature policies to stay up to date with new laws and procedures. I also prepared forecast reports and recommended changes in operational processes. Additionally, I tested system security, detected vulnerability threats, and diagnosed network equipment connectivity problems. I monitored network equipment and software and tested computer software. I also coordinated and scheduled system backups and tested system recovery procedures. Another thing I looked for was process improvement, which involved identifying and analyzing existing processes, systems, and procedures, and developing solutions to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and quality. By improving processes, systems, and procedures, I ensured that my organization met its goals and objectives in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Lastly, I developed emergency action plans and system security certification and documentation.<br>
